#' Between/Within SD Ratio for Time-Invariant Variables
#'
#' @importFrom stats sd
#' @description
#' Computes the between-panel and within-panel standard deviations for
#' specified variables, along with their ratio. This diagnostic helps assess
#' whether FEVD/FEF methods may improve upon standard FE estimation.
#'
#' @param data A data frame containing the panel data.
#' @param variables A character vector of variable names to analyze.
#' @param id Character string naming the panel identifier variable.
#'
#' @return A data frame with columns:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{variable}{Variable name}
#'   \item{sd_between}{Between-panel standard deviation}
#'   \item{sd_within}{Within-panel standard deviation}
#'   \item{bw_ratio}{Ratio of between to within SD}
#' }
#'
#' @details
#' For truly time-invariant variables, the within-panel SD should be zero
#' (or near-zero due to numerical precision), giving an infinite ratio.
#' Plumper and Troeger (2007, p. 134) define the b/w ratio as the between SD
#' of a variable divided by its within SD, which is what this function
#' reports.
#'
#' Plumper and Troeger (2007, Section 6) compare the root mean squared error
#' of the FE and FEVD estimators of a rarely changing variable in a Monte
#' Carlo design with N = 30 units and T = 20 periods (their footnote 13
#' reports that the findings for rarely changing variables were confirmed
#' for N in 15 to 100 and T in 20 to 100). The b/w ratio above
#' which FEVD has the lower RMSE depends on the (unobservable) correlation
#' between the rarely changing variable and the unit effects: about 0.2 when
#' the correlation is 0, about 1.7 at a correlation of 0.3, about 2.8 at 0.5
#' and close to 3.8 at 0.8 (their Fig. 4, pp. 135-136). The often quoted
#' threshold of 1.7 is therefore a result for corr(z, u) = 0.3 from their
#' Fig. 4 (N = 30, T = 20), and Plumper and Troeger themselves write that
#' they "cannot offer a simple rule of thumb", adding (p. 136) that "the
#' odds are that at a b/w ratio of at least 2.8, the variable is better
#' included into the stage 2 estimation". This function prints these
#' thresholds for orientation only.
#'
#' Two caveats from Plumper and Troeger apply. First, the FEVD (and FEF)
#' coefficient on a time-invariant or rarely changing variable is biased
#' whenever that variable is correlated with the unobserved unit effects
#' (p. 129); the bias is the usual omitted variable bias and does not vanish
#' with a high b/w ratio. Second, this correlation cannot be observed or
#' tested, because the unit effects are unobservable (p. 135); the trade-off
#' between the bias of FEVD and the inefficiency of FE for rarely changing
#' variables therefore rests on an untestable assumption.
